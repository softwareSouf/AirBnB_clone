# AirBnB clone - The console :fire:

```markdown
## Introduction

Welcome to our AirBnB clone project! This is the first step towards building a full web application that mimics the functionality of AirBnB. In this project, we'll be focusing on creating a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting operations.

## Learning Objectives

By working on this project, you'll gain a deeper understanding of various concepts, including:

- Creating a Python package
- Building a command interpreter using the cmd module
- Implementing unit testing for a large project
- Serializing and deserializing classes
- Writing and reading JSON files
- Managing datetime and UUID
- Utilizing *args and **kwargs in functions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Python 3.8.5

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

### Usage

To start the command interpreter, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python3 console.py
```

The command interpreter will allow you to manage your AirBnB objects, perform operations, and interact with the system.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `models/`: Contains classes for different AirBnB objects.
- `engine/`: Contains the file storage engine.
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests for the project.

## Unit Testing

We have implemented comprehensive unit tests to ensure the functionality and reliability of the project. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover tests
```
